This file contains registrations for Kerberos key usage numbers.  Send
email to ghudson@mit.edu with corrections or requests for new assignments.

Each entry should contain:
* A number
* A reference to the governing standard, with section number
* A sybolic constant name if one is included in the governing standard
* A description of the key usage value if one is included in the
  governing standard, or a brief indication of the associated protocol
  message if it is not obvious from the constant name

Numbers may have multiple entries if there are conflicts.

1024 (rfc4120 7.5.1)
        Encryption for application use in protocols that do not
        specify key usage values

The following are informational notes for values in the 512-1023
range:

513 KEY_USAGE_PA_FX_COOKIE (MIT krb5 encrypted FAST cookie)
514 KEY_USAGE_PA_AS_FRESHNESS (MIT krb5 freshness tokens)

RFC 3961 and RFC 4120 specify key usage values as unsigned, but in
practice there is some use of negative values (which are encoded as
two's complement when used in key derivation).  The following are
informational notes for negative values:

-18 KU_DIGEST_ENCRYPT (Heimdal digest service)
-19 KU_DIGEST_OPAQUE (Heimdal digest service)
-21 KU_KRB5SIGNEDPATH (Heimdal and MIT krb5 S4U2Proxy without PACs)
-25 KU_H5L_COOKIE (Heimdal encrypted FAST cookie)
