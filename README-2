This repository contains registries for Kerberos 5 protocol number
spaces which are not managed by IANA.  The information here was
largely compiled by Taylor Yu, with some updates by Greg Hudson.

If you need an assignment in one of these number spaces, send mail to
ghudson@mit.edu with as much information about the proposed use as
possible.
